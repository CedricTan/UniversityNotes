\section{Introduction to Research Design}
Aims of this module:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Make you competent consumers of research: how do you tell whether you can trust a study's results? 
	\item Enable you to design your own studies and conduct your own research.
\end{itemize}
What does it mean to be fair?
\begin{itemize}
	\item The deck should not be stacked in favour of your preferred hypothesis!
	\item Choose a method that is \textit{unbiased}.
	\item If you find the opposite to what you expect to find, you need to say so and you need to report it.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Causes of effects}
These questions are never answerable beyond a reasonable doubt because the event has already happened and the number of potential causes can be infinite.

Take the example of Hilary Clinton and the 2016 Presidential Election:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the effect of misogynistic remarks on voters' evaluation of political candidates?
	\item What is the effect of anti-trade rhetoric on party support?
\end{itemize}
Manipulation is also a key factor in cause and effect.
\begin{center}
	\textbf{Manipulation is the assignment to different values of the treatment/explanatory variable.}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Terminology}
Variables
Categorical
Ordinal
Continuous

Outcome and Explanatory Variables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Outcome: dependent variable (DV) and denoted by $Y$.
	\item Explanatory: independent variable (IV) or "treatment" and denoted by $X$ or $Z$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description}
Sometimes political science is concerned with describing rather than finding cause and effect. Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Did the share of marriages 
	\item From 1990 to now, how 
\end{itemize}
Try to look for questions that ask 'what is'.

\subsection{Research Integrity}
Research as the search for the truth.
Challenges related to bad science:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Underreporting: researchers do not report all the tests that they conducted
	\item P-hacking: researchers choose the model specification based on which model gives the best results
	\item Biased research outputs that are unethical
\end{itemize}
Here are some steps to maintain integrity.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pre-register our hypotheses
	\item Report null findings
	\item Replicate each others studies
	\item Correct mistakes
	\item Learn together
\end{itemize}
