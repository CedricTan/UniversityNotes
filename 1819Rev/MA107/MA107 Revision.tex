\abstract{

This is a review of mathematics lectures by James Ward in Michaelmas Term of 2018. The notes are mine fully and may not be authentic to the lecturer's as they have been modified.

The format of this material is usually recounted slide by slide but some slides may be merged together as the material fits appropriately with one another.
